### What I've Learned

This is, in my opinion, one of the coolest projects I have ever worked on so far. I had the opportunity to study machine learning in a course conducted by Professor Jinho Choi, who is one of the authors of the Emora State Transition Dialogue Manager (Emora STDM). According to what I understood of the course, Emora STDM is a development framework for establishing human-computer dialogue. It was simple to use and comprehend, and the outcomes were truly amazing. I was able to implement Emora STDM in a project for my final assignment, and the results were beyond my expectations. The way the dialogue manager was able to understand and respond to human input was truly remarkable. Furthermore, with the support of OpenAI's API to handle unexpected questions, our project was able to handle a wide range of queries and provide accurate and meaningful responses. This experience has truly opened my eyes to the potential of artificial intelligence and the necessity of natural language processing in improving user interactions with technology.
