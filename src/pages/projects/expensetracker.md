summary: "The expense tracker application, called Expense Tracker, was inspired by my need of a better budgeting tool. Utilizing the 50/30/20 budgeting rule, the application divides bi-weekly pay checks into Savings Contributions and Debit Repayment for 50%, Fixed Expenses for 30%, and all other wants or transaction for 20%. The application also enables users to track recurring expenses and financial goals."

### What I've Learned

The expense tracker project was my first real dive into creating a financial application and using Xata.io. The goal was to create a simple application to help me keep track of expenses using the 50/30/20 budgeting rule to manage my financial goals. Even though the project is still a work in progress, I have learned so far how to implement a Xata database and work with Next.js API routes to GET and POST data. This project has also improved my understanding of Material UI and TypeScript.
