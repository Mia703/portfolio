### What I've Learned

The Notepad App website was a project I developed as part of my Usability Testing course. The website is simple and accessible, allowing users to learn about the application quickly and easily. Working on this website taught me a lot about user-centred design, with a particular focus on accessibility. For this course wirefames, prototypes, guerilla and formal usability tests, and heuristic evaluations were conducted, which was a completely new and insightful experience for me. Overall this project taught me how crucial it is to test and iterate based on user feedback.
