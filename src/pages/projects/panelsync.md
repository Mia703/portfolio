summary: "PanelSync is a platform for book enthusiasts to track their reading progress and organize their reading lists. The application enables users search for and filter books and save or delete books they are currently reading. Created collaboratively with a classmate as a final assignment for the course ICT 4300: Web Systems and Information. Book data was sourced from Open Library. At the completion of this course on March 16th, 2024, the Supabase database was frozen and all data was erased."

### What I've Learned

PanelSync was an interesting project where I built a book-tracking application to help users keep track of their reading progress. Through this project, I gained experience working with full-stack development, specifically integrating user authentication and managing data across multiple platforms. I also learned how to fetch and display data from multiple platforms, including the Supabase database. A valuable takeaway from this project was learning how to integrate various technologies into a seamless experience and mastering the process of cleaning data. I utilised Open Library's bulk data dumps to pre-load book information into the application. This proved to be an interesting challenge, as I had to navigate through the data file, clean it, and import it into the Supabase database for display in the app. If I were to recreate this project, I would consider using Open Library's web API instead.
