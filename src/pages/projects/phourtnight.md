summary: 'Phourtnight was a collaborative final project for my undergraduate degree in computer science. With four other teammates, we developed a full-stack collaborative game for housemates. You can play with any number of people, but the goal is to earn points by completing chores, levelling up, and collecting lootboxes containing rewards . The game is designed to gamify household tasks that roommates would traditionally have to divide andÂ complete.'

### What I've Learned



This project marked my first experience developing a dynamic web application rather than a static webpage, offering a valuable introduction to the application development process and revealing areas for personal growth. Having recently learned the fundamentals of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, I was able to apply those skills to front-end development, a critical component of our team effort. While my teammates focused on implementing the backend, I took responsibility for designing the frontend, ensuring a cohesive user experience.

The project also provided hands-on exposure to SCRUM methodology. Working in sprints, our team collaborated to develop features, track progress, and present updates to our class. While everyone contributed collectively, I played a significant role in organizing meetings, ensuring tasks were effectively assigned, and keeping us on track to meet deadlines. This experience not only honed my technical skills but also deepened my understanding of team dynamics and project management.
