### What I've Learned

The expense tracker project, also name Expense Tracker, was my first real dive into creating a financial app and using Xata.io. The goal was to help myself track my expenses better using the 50/30/20 budgeting rule to manage my financial goals. The app was built with Next.js, React, Material UI, and TailwindCSS for the frontend and Xata.io for the database management.

Even though the project is still a work in progress, I have learned so far how to implement a database and work with Next.js API routes. This project has also improved my understanding of Material UI and TypeScript.
