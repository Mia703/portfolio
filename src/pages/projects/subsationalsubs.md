### What I've Learned

This project was about simulating the ordering process for a restaurant. I used HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to build the frontend and back end of this application, and a class-provided API to handle order submissions. I learned how to structure GET and POST request properly and how to manage API responses. Additionally, this project gave me more experience working with external data sources.
