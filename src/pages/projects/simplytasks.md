### What I've Learned

SimplyTasks was a project aimed at creating a simple no-frills task management app. This project taught me the power of focusing on core features without adding unnecessary complexity and the capabilities of jQuery. I worked primarily in HTML, CSS, and jQuery, which help med further solidify my frontend skills. This project also taught me the versatility of jQuery UI. Authentication is done through LocalStorage.
