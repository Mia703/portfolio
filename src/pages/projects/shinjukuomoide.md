summary: "In September 2024, I had the opportunity to work on an exciting project for a client preparing to launch an Airbnb rental in Tokyo's vibrant Shinjuku district. The project titled, Shinjuku Omoide, was focused on creating a compelling online presence for a rental space that would be available starting February 2025.

### Project Goals & Requirements

The client has several key objectives for the website. First, they wanted an informative rental details page that would serve as a dedicated space to showcase the accommodation and its amenities. Additionally, they needed a blog to document the transformation of the rental space, generating interest among prospective guests. Finally, the requested a clear and accessible rules page to ensure English-speaking renters could easily understand the house rules and expectations.

### Development Process

To bring the client's vision to live, I utilized WordPress and Elementor. The process began with designing and wireframing, where I created an initial layout to ensure easy navigation and a visually appealing interface.

### What I Learned

From this project, I created my first developer-client contract and reviewed expectations of both the client and the web developer. Establishing clear agreements and outlining project milestones helped ensure transparency and smooth collaboration throughout the development process. Additionally, I gained valuable experience in managing project timelines, adapting to client feedback, and refining my skills in balancing aesthetics with functionality.

<br />

User experience was also a key consideration through the project. As ensuring easy navigation and clear information significantly enhances engagement and reduced potential misunderstandings for international guests.

Working on "Shinjuku Omoide" was a fulfilling experience, and it reinforced the importance of strategic web design in the hospitality industry, client communication, and user-centric design. This project was a testament to how a well-crafted website can drive interest and create a seamless experience for future guests. The insights gained from this project will undoubtedly inform and enhance my future projects.
