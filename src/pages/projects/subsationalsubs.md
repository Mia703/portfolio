### What I've Learned

This project was about learning how to code GET and POST requests to an API. Using HTML and CSS to build the frontend of this application and JavaScript for the backend. A class-provided API was used to get menu items and handle order submissions. I learned how to structure GET and POST request properly and how to manage API responses. Additionally, this project gave me more experience working with external data sources.
