### What I've Learned

Flavour Town Subs was my first experience with mobile development. Using Flutter and Dart, the mobile application allows users to simulate a restaurant ordering process. Users can select food from a menu, add items to a cart, and "checkout". I learned a lot about building a cross-platform application and how Flutter simplifies the process of creating apps for both Android and iOS. This was a great project for diving into mobile UI design and understanding the differences between web and mobile development. It helped me see how mobile apps are structured and how to handle user input in a mobile context.
